      <h2>Understanding Canine Welfare</h2>
      <p>
        Canine welfare encompasses the complete well-being of dogs, including their physical health, mental state, behavior, and environment. 
        A comprehensive look at welfare involves both objective measures (such as heart rate and cortisol levels) and subjective assessments 
        (like behavioral observations).

    <section>
      <h2>Key Welfare Frameworks: The Five Freedoms and Beyond</h2>
      <p>
        The Five Freedoms provide a foundation for animal care and are as applicable to dogs as they are to farm animals. They state that animals should have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freedom from Hunger and Thirst:</strong> Continuous access to fresh water and a nutritious diet (Farm Animal Welfare Council, 1979).</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom from Discomfort:</strong> A secure environment with appropriate shelter (Farm Animal Welfare Council, 1979).</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom from Pain, Injury, or Disease:</strong> Prompt prevention and treatment (Farm Animal Welfare Council, 1979).</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom to Express Normal Behavior:</strong> Adequate space, proper facilities, and social interaction (Farm Animal Welfare Council, 1979).</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom from Fear and Distress:</strong> Conditions that protect against mental suffering (Farm Animal Welfare Council, 1979).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Modern animal welfare science expands on these concepts by considering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Biological Health:</strong> Is the dog free of injury and disease?</li>
        <li><strong>Affective States:</strong> Does the dog experience positive feelings such as comfort and joy, and minimal negative feelings?</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Behavior:</strong> Can the dog express behaviors like playing, exploring, and socializing?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Ferreira, 2008; Fraser, 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another framework, the Five Domains Model, broadens this perspective to include Nutrition, Environment, Health, Behavior, and Mental State, 
        emphasizing that welfare is about promoting positive experiences as much as preventing negatives (Whole-Dog Journal, n.d.; Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, n.d.).

    <!-- Behavioral and Physiological Indicators -->
    <section>
      <h2>Behavioral and Physiological Indicators</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs communicate their well-being through behavior and physiology. Happy dogs often show relaxed postures, wagging tails, and curiosity. 
        In contrast, stressed dogs may exhibit behaviors like excessive yawning, lip licking, and pacing (Beerda et al., 1998). 
        Physiological measurements—such as increased cortisol levels and heart rate spikes—can also indicate stress. These indicators, when used in combination, 
        provide a holistic view of canine welfare.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Objective vs. Subjective Assessments -->
    <section>
      <h2>Objective vs. Subjective Assessments</h2>
      <p>
        Objective data (e.g., weight, cortisol levels) provide measurable insights, while subjective observations (e.g., a caregiver’s assessment) capture nuanced aspects of a dog’s behavior. 
        A balanced welfare evaluation uses both approaches to ensure that a dog is truly thriving.
