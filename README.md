# Canine Welfare Insights

Canine Welfare Insights is a website I created to share important information about how to care for dogs. The site is designed to help people understand what dogs need to be happy and healthy. It covers topics such as overall dog welfare, common challenges dogs face (like stress in shelters or issues with training), and provides resources for further learning.
